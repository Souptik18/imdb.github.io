# imdb.github.io
its basically an IMDB clone 

This project has 
index.html, movies.html, favourites.html, script.js, and styles.css to complete the project 

The project is a web application that allows users to search for movies using the OMDB API (Open Movie Database) and save their favorite movies to a favorites list.

The application provides a search input where users can enter the title of a movie they want to search for.

As the user types, the application fetches movie search results from the OMDB API and displays them in a list. The user can click on a movie from the search results to view its details on a separate page. Also, they can see if they have added any favorite movies or not Additionally a favorites button is given to see the favorites page also.

On the movie details page, users can see the poster and the plot of the movie. The favorites list is displayed on another page favourites.html, showing the movies that the user has added as favorites. The user can also remove movies from the favorites list if desired.

The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
